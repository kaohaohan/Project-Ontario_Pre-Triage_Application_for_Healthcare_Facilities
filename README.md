# Ontario Pre-Triage Application for Healthcare Facilities

A comprehensive C++ application designed to streamline the patient admission process during pandemics, effectively managing the pre-triage system for healthcare facilities in Ontario.

## Project Highlights

- Developed as part of a rigorous academic curriculum, showcasing advanced C++ programming skills, object-oriented design, and data management.
- Features a robust menu-driven user interface enabling seamless registration and admission of patients based on urgency and needs.
- Employs dynamic memory management to handle patient data efficiently, ensuring data integrity and system stability.
- Integrates custom data structures for optimal data storage and retrieval, facilitating quick access to patient records and wait times.
- Utilizes file I/O for persistent data storage, allowing the system to maintain state between sessions for consistent patient management.

## Core Functionality

- **Patient Registration**: Supports detailed screening for patients, distinguishing between contagion testing and triage needs.
- **Admission Process**: Dynamically updates wait times and manages patient admission based on the type of care required.
- **Data Persistence**: Implements a save-and-load feature to resume operations accurately, ensuring no data loss between application restarts.

## Technical Achievements

- Designed and implemented a modular application structure with extensive use of inheritance and polymorphism, showcasing the ability to extend and maintain complex software systems.
- Successfully managed dynamic memory across multiple modules without leaks or corruption, demonstrating proficiency in resource management in C++.
- Applied advanced C++ features such as templates and operator overloading to enhance the application's flexibility and efficiency.

## Reflections

- Tackled challenging aspects of C++ and object-oriented programming, significantly improving problem-solving skills and deepening understanding of software design principles.
- Overcame hurdles related to dynamic memory management and file I/O operations, learning to debug complex scenarios and ensure robust application performance.

## Future Directions

- Explore the integration of a graphical user interface (GUI) to further improve user experience.
- Implement network capabilities for remote access to the pre-triage system by healthcare professionals.
